                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing or using AlgoWorkout, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not
                    agree to these terms, do not use the platform. These terms apply to all users, including visitors,
                    free-tier users, and paid subscribers.</p>

                <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
                <p>AlgoWorkout is an <strong>educational algorithmic trading platform</strong>. We provide AI-generated
                    strategy hypotheses, automated multi-stage validation through The Strategy Grinder pipeline, kill
                    reports, stress testing results, walk-forward validation, and educational content about quantitative
                    trading.</p>
                <p>The platform is powered by a 7-stage pipeline using multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, DeepSeek,
                    Anthropic, Google) for strategy generation, critique, and analysis.</p>

                <div class="disclaimer">
                    <p><strong>⚠️ THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE</strong></p>
                </div>

                <h2>3. Not Financial Advice</h2>
                <p><strong>This is the most important section of these terms.</strong></p>
                <p>AlgoWorkout is for <strong>educational purposes only</strong>. Nothing on this platform constitutes
                    financial advice, investment recommendations, or solicitation to buy, sell, or hold any financial
                    instrument. Specifically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All strategies displayed on AlgoWorkout are <strong>hypothetical</strong></li>
                    <li>Past backtest performance does <strong>NOT</strong> guarantee future results</li>
                    <li>Surviving the 7-stage pipeline does <strong>NOT</strong> mean a strategy will be profitable in
                        live trading</li>
                    <li>"Survivor" strategies are educational examples — not trade recommendations</li>
                    <li>Kill reports and graveyard data are for learning purposes only</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>You are solely responsible for your own trading and investment decisions.</strong>
                    AlgoWorkout,
                    its founders, employees, and affiliates bear no responsibility for any financial losses you may
                    incur
                    from trading based on information found on this platform.</p>
                <p>If you need financial advice, consult a licensed financial advisor.</p>

                <h2>4. Account Responsibility</h2>
                <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. Keep your password and
                    API keys confidential. You must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide accurate information when creating your account</li>
                    <li>Maintain one account per person — multiple accounts are not permitted</li>
                    <li>Notify us immediately at <strong>support@algoworkout.com</strong> if you suspect unauthorized
                        access</li>
                    <li>Not share your account credentials or API keys with others</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
                <p>You agree not to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reverse engineer</strong> the pipeline — do not attempt to extract, reconstruct, or
                        replicate The Strategy Grinder's architecture, prompts, or orchestration logic</li>
                    <li><strong>Extract LLM prompts</strong> — do not attempt to recover the system prompts used at any
                        pipeline stage through prompt injection or other techniques</li>
                    <li><strong>Automated scraping</strong> — do not scrape, crawl, or programmatically extract data
                        from the platform outside of the provided API</li>
                    <li><strong>Resell pipeline results</strong> — do not resell, redistribute, or commercially
                        repackage pipeline results, kill reports, or strategy data without written permission</li>
                    <li><strong>Abuse the API</strong> — do not exceed rate limits, flood endpoints, or use the API in
                        any way that degrades service for other users</li>
                    <li><strong>Misrepresent</strong> — do not present AlgoWorkout results as personal research or claim
                        pipeline-generated strategies as your own proprietary work in a commercial context</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>The Strategy Grinder pipeline — including its code, prompts, multi-LLM orchestration architecture,
                    stage configurations, and kill gate logic — is proprietary to AlgoWorkout.</p>
                <p>Strategies generated for your account through your pipeline runs are yours to use for personal
                    educational and trading purposes. However, the underlying pipeline technology, the platform's
                    codebase, and the AlgoWorkout brand remain the intellectual property of AlgoWorkout Ltd.</p>
                <p>The educational content, kill reports, and graveyard data published by AlgoWorkout on the platform
                    are
                    owned by AlgoWorkout and may not be reproduced in bulk without permission.</p>

                <h2>7. API Usage</h2>
                <p>API access is available on Builder and Institutional plans, subject to the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rate limits</strong> — 100 requests/hour for Builder, unlimited for Institutional</li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication</strong> — all API requests must include a valid Bearer token</li>
                    <li><strong>Fair use</strong> — API usage must be consistent with normal platform usage patterns
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Abuse</strong> — excessive or abusive API usage will result in rate limiting, temporary
                        suspension, or permanent revocation of API access</li>
                </ul>
                <p>See the <a href="../resources/api-docs.html" style="color: var(--primary);">API Documentation</a> for
                    full technical details.</p>

                <p>Paid plans are billed monthly through Stripe. By subscribing, you agree to:</p>

                <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p><strong>AlgoWorkout is not responsible for any trading losses.</strong> The platform is educational.
                    We make no guarantees about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The future performance of any strategy, whether it survived the pipeline or not</li>
                    <li>The accuracy of backtest results (backtests use historical data and simplified assumptions)</li>
                    <li>The completeness of kill reports or adversarial critiques</li>
                    <li>Continuous, uninterrupted access to the platform or API</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, AlgoWorkout's total liability to you for any claims arising
                    from your use of the platform is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the
                    claim.</p>

                <h2>10. Termination</h2>
                <p>We may terminate or suspend your account if you:</p>
